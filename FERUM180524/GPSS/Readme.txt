1. The online GP model is in the folder "ogpall" including the references as well. It will call "netlab3_3" in parameter learning.

2. The functions are as follow:
	ssini   % initialize reliability problem
	gpini   % initialize gp model
	ss_da	% main program
	ss_gcs, ssda_graph, ssda_step, ssda_y_threshold, etc.  % called by ss_da
	EX1,..., EX4  % Defined 4 examples
