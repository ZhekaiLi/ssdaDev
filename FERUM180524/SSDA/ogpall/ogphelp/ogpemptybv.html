<H1> ogpemptybv

<h2>
Purpose
</h2>
<p>Adds input elements to the BV set without altering the GP.

<p><h2>
Synopsis
</h2>
<p><PRE>
[residErr] = ogpemtpybv(cx,iOpt,addMax);</PRE>
<P>

<p><h2>
Description
</h2>
<p>
<p><CODE>ogpemptybv(cx)</CODE> - increases the BV set in the
Gaussian Process <CODE>net</CODE> by adding the inputs from <CODE>cx</CODE>.

<p>The addition to the BV set is sequential (i.e. a single element of <CODE>cx</CODE>
at each step) and if the feature-space distance <CODE>gamma</CODE> between the
subspace determined by the BV set and the input is
smaller than the threshold (stored in the structure <CODE>net</CODE>), then the
respective input is not added.  This helps mantaining a well-conditioned
Gram matrix.

<p>A second form of adding elements to the BV set is to add them according to
the "novelty" they bring, measured by the distance from the subspace
determined by the existing BVs. This requires a nonzero value <CODE>iOpt</CODE> as
the third argument to the function:
<PRE>
[net] = ogpemptybv(net,cx,iOpt)</PRE>
<P>

<p>There is a possibility to limit the number of added BVs by specifying a
fourth argument

<p><PRE>
[net] = ogpemptybv(net,cx,iOpt,addMax)</PRE>
<P>

<p>which limits the maximum number of new BV additions to <CODE>addMax</CODE>.

<p>If you want to limit the number of BVs and not have addition based on the
distances (ie. <CODE>iOpt==0</CODE>), then you should call the function with four
arguments, where the third is set to zero.

<p>The additional output argument <CODE>residErr</CODE> tells the maximal distance of
the new subspace from the input elements that were not included into the new
BV set.
